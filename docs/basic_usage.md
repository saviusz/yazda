# Basic usage

First, power on the Controller and obtain its address.

## Connecting to the Controller
To manage the Camera Dolly, provide the Controllerâ€™s WebSocket address to the dashboard.
The dashboard will use this address to connect and initialize communication.

Once connected, the dashboard can send various commands to the Dolly.

## Status
The dashboard may require the current Dolly status. This is provided via the [Status Message](status.md#status-message), which is emitted after every status update.

You can also request an update manually using the [Get Status Command](./status.md#get-status-command).

## Calibration
Immediately after power-up, the Camera Dolly is not calibrated, and only a limited set of actions is available.

To calibrate, send the [Calibration Command](calibration.md#calibrate-command).

## Movement
Movement is the primary function of the Camera Dolly.
To initiate movement, send the [Move Command](motion.md#move-command).
